# Pet Adoption Website

This pet adoption website is a project developed as part of my Codecademy journey to practice using React Router for client-side routing in a React application. The website allows users to explore and adopt animals of different species. Users can view all animals of a particular species and access detailed profiles of specific animals.

## Features

- **Browse Animals:** Explore animals of various species, including dogs, cats, birds, and more.
- **Species-Specific Pages:** Dedicated pages for each species, displaying all available animals of that species.
- **Animal Profiles:** View detailed profiles of specific animals, including images, descriptions, and adoption information.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Implemented React Router for smooth and seamless navigation between different pages and animal profiles without page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** Utilized React Router for implementing client-side routing in the application.
- **JavaScript:** Used JavaScript for interactive functionality and dynamic content.
- **CSS:** Styled with CSS to create an attractive and responsive user interface.
